What a wonderful error message.  I love the compiler!

Code:

    [stdio.c]

	115 int vsnprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, va_list ap)
	116 {
	...
    176    str[n] = va_arg(ap, char);
    ...

Message:

    stdio.c: In function `vsnprintf':
    stdio.c:176: warning: `char' is promoted to `int' when passed through `...'
    stdio.c:176: warning: (so you should pass `int' not `char' to `va_arg')
    stdio.c:176: note: if this code is reached, the program will abort
