Consider making driver read()/write() fns take an additional arg into which the driver will place
the number of bytes actually read/written.  Otherwise there is no way of detecting short
reads/writes.

Ensure that block-oriented read()/write() support short reads and writes.  In the case of ATA, a
complete block must always be read.  In the case of short writes, the write must be implemented as
a full-block read-modify-write.

Back out all this short reads/writes nonsense.  Block devices should only ever deal in whole blocks.
