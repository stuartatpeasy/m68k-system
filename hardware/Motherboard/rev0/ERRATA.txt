Major (prevents design working as manufactured)
-----------------------------------------------
16	nUW/nUR/nLW/nLR uses incorrect outputs on 74HC139
17	MAX238 - pins 9 & 11 should not be shorted; should instead be 1uF between pin 11 (+) and pin 9 (-).
27	Incorrect sense on nATAIRQ - should be ATAIRQ


Moderate (makes assembly fiddly, or affects usability)
------------------------------------------------------
1	LED footprint hole size is too small
2	470n capacitors have 0.1" pitch holes; 0.2" pitch needed
3	Reset switch footprint - spacing incorrect, and holes are too small
4	Power LED is too close to U305
8	Heatsink holes are too small
12	R701, R704 too close together
13	J710 (IDE) too close to R701, R704 - fouls
14	L902 footprint - hole spacing is too great
19	Battery footprint is entirely wrong
21	Buzzer is a very tight fit.  Move U801 left?
24	J601, J602 (serial) signal pin spacing is incorrect; signal pin hole size is too small
25	Serial port connectors are too close together


Minor (cosmetic)
----------------
5	LED silkscreen outline is too small
6	R106, R401 - footprint is wrong?  Appears as if common pin is not connected to VCC
7	Serial ports have no channel designators (SER A, SER B) on silkscreen
9	LED silkscreen - orientation mark is obscured by holes
10	"DISC" silkscreen text is partially obscured by U703 footprint
11	C911 designator obscured by R705 pad
15	Power switch operates with incorrect sense
18	Significant switching noise (250mV spikes, 30mV sq wave @~250kHz on +12V supply)
21	(deleted - not an issue)
22	D601 (bi-col) very bright - increase current-limit R
23	D701 (HDD) is quite dim


Enhancements
------------
26	Some signal names in MEMCTL PLD have changed; update schematic to match.
