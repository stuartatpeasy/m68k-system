Major (prevents design working as manufactured)

-----------------------------------------------


byte-swap ATA data bus



Moderate (makes assembly fiddly, or affects usability)

------------------------------------------------------

2	470n capacitors have 0.1" pitch holes; 0.2" pitch needed

3	Reset switch footprint - spacing incorrect, and holes are too small

12	R701, R704 too close together

14	L902 footprint - hole spacing is too great

19	Battery footprint is entirely wrong

check sense of power switch.  maybe fixed this twice (i.e. unfixed it) in the schematic design?

some expansion slot connectors are too close together, maybe




Minor (cosmetic)

----------------

5	LED silkscreen outline is too small

6	R106, R401 - footprint is wrong?  Appears as if common pin is not connected to VCC

9	LED silkscreen - orientation mark is obscured by holes

18	Significant switching noise (250mV spikes, 30mV sq wave @~250kHz on +12V supply)

22	D601 (bi-col) very bright - increase current-limit R

23	D701 (HDD) is quite dim




Enhancements

------------

26	Some signal names in MEMCTL PLD have changed; update schematic to match.

Pull-up to prevent buzzer buzzing when RESET is held?
